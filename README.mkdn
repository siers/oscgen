OscillationGenerator -- the raw signal generator.
===

Requirements
---
Get something that accepts raw data, and tell it to read it as 8bit/sample && 44kHz.

Usage
---
Set the sound to generate add this line:
    `wave :type => :sine, :frequency => note(:do)`
in
    `OscillationGenerator.run do`
block. Define new generators with
    `define :generator do |t|`
where t will represent time in [0; 360).

You can change the output settings with bash pipes or 
    `output`
command. Same thing with
    `rate`
.

Note function is a helper method that'll generate the frequency for your selected sound. Pass the note as the first argument(e.g. :do). Then you can pass :bemmole or :sharp and *number*.ocatve, like so:
    `wave :type => :cosine,    :frequency => note(:mi, :bemmole, 1.octave), :offset => 90`
. The :offset argument will push the graph bit further. 360 will represent a full lap.
